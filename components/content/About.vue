      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Bjorn Verbakel. I am an HBO-ICT student at Fontys University
        of Applied Sciences in Eindhoven, with a focus on front-end development.

        In addition to web development, I'm also interested in 3D modeling. I
        like exploring how 3D elements can be used in websites or applications
        to create more engaging and interactive experiences.
